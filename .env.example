# Google OAuth Configuration
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID (or edit existing one)
# 3. Configure the following settings:
#
#    Application type: Web application
#
#    Authorized JavaScript origins (REQUIRED - these are what matter for popup flow):
#      Development:
#        - http://localhost:3000
#        - http://127.0.0.1:3000
#      (Add both localhost and 127.0.0.1 to avoid issues)
#
#    Authorized redirect URIs (add these as well):
#      Development:
#        - http://localhost:3000
#        - http://127.0.0.1:3000
#        - http://localhost:3000/
#        - http://127.0.0.1:3000/
#
#    Production (when deploying):
#      Authorized JavaScript origins:
#        - https://yourdomain.com
#      Authorized redirect URIs:
#        - https://yourdomain.com
#        - https://yourdomain.com/
#
# 4. Copy the Client ID and paste it below
# 5. IMPORTANT: After adding the Client ID, restart your dev server (npm run dev)
#
# Note: You do NOT need the Client Secret for frontend Google OAuth
